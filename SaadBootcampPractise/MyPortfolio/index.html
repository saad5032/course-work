            <p class="p3">I am Saaduddin Syed currently enrolled in the masters program of Computer Science at NIU. I
                was born in the city of Warangal; Telangana and I completed my primary school at St. Pauls
                English Medium School.I completed my high school at Gowtham Model School, Mehdipatnam passed with 7.8
                cgpa then immediately enrolled in Intermediate at MS. Junior College where I tried my best to have a free
                seat in Engineering by securing rank in Eamcet exam to not further burden my parents financially. The
                major I studied in Engineering was Electronics and Communication where I learned many
                concepts and have good grip on understanding of Embedded systems anf microProcessors. I tried hard to
                secure a second rank in my department securing a G.P.A of 8.58/10. As I was about to complete my Engineering I came to know that
                Programming is an important skill to learn especially during a pandemic, to boost ones career at
                that moment I decided to enroll in a masters Program in Computer Science where I came to know
                about the web development where your little programming can give you a beautiful visualization
                like webpages but still, I didnt want to limit the area and decided to pursue my career as a Full
                stack web developer to have the complete skillset of front and back end.</p>
